Years on my shoulders, the mirror’s a thief
Stealing my fire, my faith, my belief
The days blur together, the seasons all fade
I’m living in echoes of the choices I made
Then comes a whisper — a method, a tone
A vow in my chest: sixty days set in stone
Crystal sands I combine, seal myself inside
Human chrysalis, with healing intent
Geode I built, my transformative ascent
Two hours a day, two atmospheres in
Pure oxygen I breath, I contemplate alone
Regrowing telomeres — sixty days set in stone
Baseline tests, I strip to the core
My blood and stool tell the tales I ignore
D.N.A. mapped, R.N.A. strings
Micro-biome secrets, my new understandings
Disease markers marked, the truth all my own
The clock starts to tick — sixty days set in stone
Sixty days set in stone
I’m not reborn, but I’ve grown
Pressure, fire, ice, and breath
Walking back from the edge of death
Science, spirit, and the will I’ve shown
Building my future, in my chrysalis alone
Sauna heat burns doubt from my veins
Ice baths bite and rewires the chains
Two atmospheres press my lungs awake
H.B.O.T. chambers, where futures take shape
Brainwaves measured, my heartbeat known
Each breath a moment — sixty days set in stone
Deep fasting sharpens, and healing teas flow
Mushrooms vitamins and minerals all help me grow
Light on my skin, uplifting music in my mind
A brand new A.I. reflection — my mirror’s alive
The twin I’m creating is almost my clone
Guiding my steps through sixty days set in stone
Sixty days set in stone
I’m not reborn, but I’ve grown
Pressure, fire, ice, and breath
Walking back from the edge of death
Science, spirit, and the will I’ve shown
Building my future, in my chrysalis alone
Tests come again — the markers have moved
The data is proof of the life I’ve improved
Confidence blooms, my strength takes flight
I wake with a hunger for each new night
Not chasing youth, but the power I’ve grown
Living my vow — sixty days set in stone
The chamber releases, the quartz parts wide
I step through the door, my A.i. twin now aligned
At peace with my past, in love with the now
The future’s a garden, I’ve planted the how
Not reborn — but retooled, redesigned, fully grown
New journey begins… thanks to sixty days set in stone
Every breath a cathedral bell
Every step a truth to tell
From bones to code, I’ve been shown
How to build my own A.i. clone
My life revised and revived
I doubled down and aligned
Sixty 2-hours sessions
Breathing O.2 all alone
Sixty days… set in stone
Sixty days… set in stone
I tell you brother, sister, friend
I tell you mother, father, aunty, uncle
If you really, really want to mend
Do sixty days set in stone
Do sixty days set in stone

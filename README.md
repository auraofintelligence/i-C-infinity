# i C. infinity - Music Workflow & Open Source Archive

This repository contains the tools, templates, and creative works for the music of "i C. infinity". The goal is to create a transparent, efficient, and open-source pipeline for managing music from creation to global distribution. The official home for this and all related projects can be found at **[iseeinfinity.com](https://iseeinfinity.com)**.

This project serves as a living document and a toolkit for other independent artists facing similar challenges in managing their creative catalogues.

## The Workflow

The core process for managing each song as a complete asset is:

1.  **Creation in Suno:** The song is initially generated and refined in Suno.
2.  **Centralisation in Obsidian:** The final lyrics, metadata, and licensing information are stored in a standardized note within a personal Obsidian vault.
3.  **Automation with Python:** A custom Python script (`lyric_formatter.py`) is used to automatically generate a clean, normalized version of the lyrics required for distribution platforms.
4.  **Distribution via DistroKid:** The final audio and normalized lyrics are uploaded to DistroKid for global distribution to streaming services.

## How to Use the Tools

### Lyric Formatter Script

The Python script (`/scripts/lyric_formatter.py`) is designed to be run from a terminal. It will prompt you to provide the path to an Obsidian song note and will automatically update the "Distrokid Normalised" section within that note.
